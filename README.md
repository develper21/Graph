# Graph Type Mix

This project explores different types of graphs and their applications.

## Overview

Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. This repository provides examples and explanations of various graph types.

## Graph Types Covered

- **Undirected Graphs**: Edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graphs (Digraphs)**: Edges have a direction.
- **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have weights or costs.
- **Unweighted Graphs**: Edges do not have weights.
- **Cyclic Graphs**: Contain cycles.
- **Acyclic Graphs**: Do not contain cycles.
- **Connected Graphs**: Every pair of vertices is connected.
- **Disconnected Graphs**: Not all vertices are connected.

## Usage
